# FileProtect
File-by-file encryption utility

This program offers file-by-file encryption, which is very handy to use with cloud services, because encrypted containers are (very) big and even tiny file changes causes full container to upload.

Features:
- File-by-file encryption/decryption using AES-256 algorithm;
- Safe file wiping support (OS dependent, external);
- Key could be stored either as regular password as file (handy on trusted computers, or to store key on usb stick);
- Cross-platform using Qt framework.
